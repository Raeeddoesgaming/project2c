    <h1 class="text-center">Story</h1>
    <p>It is 6:30am in the morning and I hear the alarm go off. It is the first day of school, but I have so many worries. What if the kids       don't like me? What if I do something embarrassing? What if the teachers don't like me? So many worries in my head. I go over to my       self care jar and pull out three pieces of paper. The first note reads "Talk about whats stressing you out." I run downstairs with the     other two pieces of paper. I go up to my mom and tell her, "What if the teachers don't like me?" and she responds with "You don't need     to worry about them not liking you everything is gonna be alright, they will like you." With that worry out of my mind I pull out another     piece of paper. It reads "Read a book." So I pull out my favorite book and start reading. I put all the worries out of my mind and         start to read. The book ends up really helping and now I feel more ready to go to school! Finally to release my last bit of stress I       pull out my final piece of paper from my jar. It reads "Engage in positive self-talk." So I put a smile on my face and look at the         mirror. I tell myself that everything is gonna be alright. I tell myself nothing embarrassing is gonna happen. I tell myself the teachers     are gonna like me and that all the kids won't dislike me. With my stress lowered I grab my school bag and I go out the door, on my way     to school.</p>
